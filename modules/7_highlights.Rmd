# Introduction

This module briefly covers highlights of various functionality in NIMBLE, namely:

 - Bayesian nonparametric mixture modeling (e.g., Dirichlet processes)
 - Reversible jump for variable selection
 - Conditional autoregressive (CAR) modeling
 - WAIC for model comparison/selection
 - calling external code (e.g., C++ or R) in models or algorithms
